Hi all, since we are using the master branch, pls be aware everyone's modification will affect other sub-group.
As a result, pls remember the following command.

Execute the following 4 commands in sequence will ensure successful and correct commitment. (You can always use "git status" to check the github file status)

Before commiting your own change, use "git pull" to pull out other's change.

After making your own change,
"git add ." to add all files to commit.
"git commit" to commit ur change. Remember to add understandable commit message.
"git push" to publish ur change.
